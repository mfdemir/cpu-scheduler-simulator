# cpu-scheduler-simulator
A C# Windows Forms project that simulates cpu scheduling using different scheduling algorithms. You can set process count, max burst time and max arrival time and program generates random processes according to the values you gave. You can then add schedulers to the simulator as many as you want with different parameters. You can then simulate generated processes with the schedulers and scheduler parameters you have selected step by step or until all processes get completed. Mean turnaround times will be shown in a graph at the end of the simulation. So you can compare mean turnaround times (performance) of the schedulers and scheduler parameters you select.
## Simulated Scheduler Algorithms:
```
Round Robbin
First Come First Serve
Highest Response Ratio
Earliest Deadline First
Multi Level Feedback Queue
Shortest Job First
```
